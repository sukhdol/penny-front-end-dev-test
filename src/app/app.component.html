      For this developer test, we are asking you to build an Angular Component
      to act as a progress indicator / loading bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this is to test your Javascript, Angular, CSS and
      creativity; We have left this intentionally vague to allow you to
      demonstrate to us how you would accomplish this in an authentic setting.
      <strong>There are no wrong answers.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We'd like you generate a new component, and insert it into the box below.
      The <code>loading</code> property emulates the effect of a long network
      request / computation and should be used to control the display of your
      component.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="component__content">
    <app-spinner *ngIf="loader.isLoading$ | async"></app-spinner>
  </div>
</div>
